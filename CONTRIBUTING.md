# Contributing to Final Project

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase.

## All Contributions Are Welcome
All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.

## Report Bugs Using GitHub's Issue Tracker
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/1mostafa-ctrl/github-final-project/issues/new).

## Write Bug Reports With Detail
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* Use consistent indentation
* Add comments to your code
* Write clear commit messages

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under this project's [LICENSE](LICENSE) (if one exists).
